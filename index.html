              The markets have performed strongly over the past 12+ months. From
              here on, however, it is likely to be a stock picker’s market.
              Markets may encounter volatility due to several events, as
              witnessed around the June 4th election results. Peter Lynch
              coached me during the GFC in 2008 at Fidelity. This short video
              (<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_060MDXeAz0">Link</a>) encapsulates his advice, which I have practiced and
              benefited from during past volatility.
